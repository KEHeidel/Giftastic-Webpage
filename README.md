# Giftastic-Webpage

APP DESCRIPTION
This is a website that shows game Gifs. The site uses an API from Giphy to pull gifs. When the buttons at the top of the screen are clicked 10 gifs will appear on the page. When a gif is clicked it will animate and then when clicked a second time the gif will become a still image. On the right side of the page is a form box with a submit button. Users can input a game title in the box and hit submit and a new clickable button will appear at the top of the page with the game name. When the button with the user search info is pressed then gif images will appear related to that game title. These gifs will also animate and become still images when clicked.
